이것저것 고려할게 많긴 했는데, 막상 풀고나니까 따로 기록할만한 것은 없다.

```python
def solution(bridge_length, weight, truck_weights):
    answer = 0
    bridge = [0] * bridge_length
    while truck_weights or sum(bridge) != 0:
        if truck_weights:
            current = truck_weights[0]
            out = bridge.pop(0)
            weight += out
            #무게 check
            if current <= weight:
                #최대 갯수와 같으면 pop
                bridge.append(current)
                weight -= current
                truck_weights.pop(0)

            else:
                bridge.append(0)
        else:
            return answer + bridge_length
                
        answer += 1
        continue 
    return answer
```
